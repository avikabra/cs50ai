# Shopping
When users shop online, not all will end up purchasing something. This program builds a nearest-neighbor classifier to solve the problem of figuring out how a website could determine a user's purchasing intent. Both training and testing data came from the file `shopping.csv`. </br>
This code is an implementation of one particular classifier. However, other classifiers, including KNearestNeighbor, Perceptron learning, or Regression could have been used. The functions intended to load data, train the model, and provide an evlauation using specificity and sensitivity were implemented by me. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 4 - shopping. </br>
