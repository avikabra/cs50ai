# Knights
A logic-based puzzle in which multiple individuals are given. Each individual is either a knight or a knave: knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. The goal was to determine which individuals were knights and knaves using propositional logic in a knowledge base. </br>
Two python files (`logic.py` and `puzzle.py`) were used throughout this project. `logic.py` was provided fully implemented and consists of a number of classes which are used in the knowledge base. A majority of `puzzle.py` was implemented by me. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 1 - knights.
