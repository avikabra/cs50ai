# Heredity
A gene heredity model that accesses a database of individuals and their parents to determine the likelihoods of developing traits or having alleles. </br>
One python file (`heredity.py`) was used throughout this project. Data was gathered from various .csv files and analyzed using the functions in the python file. Three processing functions were implemented by me while the rest were provided. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 2 - heredity.
