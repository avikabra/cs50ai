# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
This project is a computer model of the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" parlor game in which you can connect any actor/actress in Hollywood to Kevin Bacon through a maximum of 6 steps. The Python Code uses a .csv IMDB database to determine the links between any two given actors/actresses in the database. </br>
This code is an implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm. This algorithm, although cost-heavy at times, will arrive at an optimal solution. A* search could have been used, but to do so would have required the creation of a heuristic, which could have proved to be faulty. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 0 - degrees. </br>
