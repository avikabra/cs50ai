# minesweeper
A Minesweeper AI that uses propositional logic to make educated next steps given past moves. </br>
Two files were used for this project (`minesweeper.py` and `runner.py`). The former was largely implemented by myself, since the framework and instructions were provided by HarvardX. The latter was provided completed. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 1 - minesweeper.
