# Pagerank
A sample-based and iterative pagerank algorithm using the random surfer pagerank model. </br>
One python file (`pagerank.py`) was used throughout this project. Data was gathered from various .csv files labeled corpuses and analyzed using the functions in the python file. Three processing functions were implemented by me while the rest were provided. The sample-based pagerank algorithm uses the `transition_model()` function whereas the `iterate_pagerank()` function employs a more exact approach. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 2 - pagerank.
