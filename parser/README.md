# Sentence Parser
An AI that parses sentences into their components (like noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositions, determiner) and extracts low level noun phrases. </br>
In the python file `parser.py`, strings of terminals and non terminals were defined such that sentences from Sherlock Holmes listed in the sentences directory could be syntactically parsed. This essentially means that the program defined a list of words, categorized them into sentence components, detailed how these components interact with each other in the English language recursively and explicitly, and used this to break down sentences where words are in this list of terminals. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 6 - parser.
