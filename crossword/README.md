 # Minesweeper
A crossword puzzle solver given a database of words using optimization algorithms like backtracking and AC3. </br>
Two files were used for this project (`crossword.py` and `generate.py`). The former was provided fully implemented with Crossword and Variable functions. The latter, however, was fully implemented by me while the framework and function names were provided. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 3 - crossword. </br>
