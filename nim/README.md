# Nim
This project allows users to play games of Nim against an AI that has gone through some number of training games. Using reinforcement  Q learning, the AI creates a dictionary of states and actions to determine what the best possible course of action is given a certain configuration. </br>
This code implements an epsilon greedy decision making algorithm using Q learning as a basis. This algorithm is used when a game with a relatively small number of actions and states is present such that each arc can be assigned a 'reward'. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 4 - nim. </br>
