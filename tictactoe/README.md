# Tic Tac Toe
This project is a computer model of a traditional tictactoe game against an informed AI. The Python Code imports pygame for the UI and uses a minimax search algorithm to determine the least-cost, optimal path for the AI. You can literally never win. </br>
This code is an implementation of the adversarial minimax search algorithm. This algorithm is used when there is a competition between two parties and is used to display the optimal path assuming that the player plays optimally too. </br>
The bulk of the code for this project was taken from the CS50 Intro to AI course provided by HarvardX. This is an implementation of Project 0 - ticatactoe. runner.py was almost entirely implemented initially. tictactoe.py, however, had only a framework and was implemented by me. </br>
